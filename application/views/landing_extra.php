	<header>About <span class="font-xtrchr">EduArch</span></header>
	<p>
		<a class="">EduArch</a> lets you epxerience a learning and teaching
		environment where a crowd of mentors or learners(which you can be!), 
		professionals or non-professionals, with their field of expertise
		can teach and share in a cumulative and interactive manner to a
		crowd of learners. Its purpose is to bridge people around the world to
		stand up and influence each other in mastering and sharing their
		crafts. Rather than dismissing the traditional classroom instruction, 
		this system strengthens it by integrating class room instructions as a 
		tool for both students and teachers to benefit from.
